This minimum participation reflects the dollar value of $WID tokens you‚Äôve purchased and own. The required amount may vary for each presale stage, so ensure ownership before each stage concludes. 

Important Note: Even $WID tokens obtained for free through our Referral link program count towards meeting the minimum participation. These tokens seamlessly combine with purchased ones, updating your balance automatically when you connect your wallet to the purchase form. 

How to Earn Free $WID Tokens: Participating in our Referral link program is simple! It‚Äôs akin to ‚Äúdigital word of mouth.‚Äù Connect your wallet used for purchasing $WID tokens to the purchase form, click the ‚Äú10% referral link‚Äù button, and receive a shareable link. When someone clicks your link and purchases, you receive 10% free tokens! For instance, if they buy 10,000 WID tokens, you earn 1000 WID tokens, automatically added to your balance. Don‚Äôt miss out on this opportunity to win big with Widcoin! **Share your Referral Link along with an Advertising Banner <Download BannersüëÜ>`,

      content: `Presale Token Handling:

During Presale:

$WID tokens are securely held in a smart contract on the Binance Smart Chain.
Post-Presale Release:

Tokens are released to your wallet after the presale concludes.
Integration for Transfer:

Add the $WID token to your Binance Smart Chain network for smooth transfer operations.
Prize Allocation:

Presale Conclusion:

At each presale‚Äôs end, the smart contract proceeds with prize allocation.
Random Selection:

A qualified wallet is randomly chosen from those meeting the minimum participation criteria.
Winnings Distribution:

Winnings, a percentage of the total collected amount, are automatically distributed in USDC (BEP-20) and USDT (BEP-20) to the selected wallet.
This straightforward guide ensures clarity on how presale tokens are handled and how prize allocation occurs, maintaining transparency and efficiency throughout the process.`,

            DDo you want to use your $WID tokens, acquired for free through the
            referral links to exceed the ‚ÄúMinimum Participation‚Äù value, and make
            them eligible to participate in the prize draw? It‚Äôs very easy:
            first, you must validate them before the end of each stage; second,
            when the sum of purchased tokens + free tokens exceeds the minimum
            value for participation, all you have to do is validate your
            participation for the prize draw by purchasing new tokens, even one
            $WID will be enough. This action is necessary and must always be
            done after exceeding the minimum value for participation, before the
            end of each stage and for all the stages of the presale in which you
            want to participate for the prize draw. If the value of the $WID
            tokens purchased already exceeds the ‚ÄúMinimum Participation‚Äù, no
            validation action is needed to participate for the prize draw,
            because everything will be validated automatically by the smart
            contract.
