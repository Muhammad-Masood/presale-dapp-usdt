            Disclaimers Regarding Mining Infrastructure Ownership

          <p className="mb-4">
            Widcoin company does not exercise ownership of any mining farm or
            companies which provide mining facilities. The company will instead
            rent these to be able to provide their services to their users.
            Therefore, anyone buying $WID agrees to be bound by the statements
            below:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-[lower-alpha] pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              By purchasing and/or staking $WID, you acknowledge and understand
              that you are not purchasing any rights, ownership, or stake in the
              mining infrastructure or equipment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users are only entitled to the revenue percentage from mining, as
              described on our website, and have no rights, claims, or
              entitlements to the mining infrastructure, operations, or any
              decision-making processes related to mining operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Widcoin company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to
              upgrade, modify, or decommission any part of the mining
              infrastructure under their usage without any obligation to notify

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Cryptocurrency Risks</h2>
          <ol className="list-[lower-alpha] pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Investment Risk: Investing in cryptocurrencies, including $WID,
              carries inherent risks. Prices can be highly volatile, and you may
              lose all or part of your investment. We do not provide investment
              advice, and you are solely responsible for your investment
              decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Security: You are responsible for maintaining the security of your
              wallet and private keys. Widcoin is not liable for any losses or
              damages resulting from your failure to secure your assets
              properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regulatory Compliance: Cryptocurrency regulations vary by
              jurisdiction. It is your responsibility to comply with the laws
              and regulations in your area regarding cryptocurrency use.
            </li>
            <li>
              No Guarantees: Widcoin makes no guarantees or warranties about the
              value, stability, or future performance of $WID tokens.
            </li>
            <li>
              Claim of tokens: The $WID selling is managed by a Smart Contract
              which will block automatically the amount of $WID you bought, and
              when the pre-sale is over, they will be released on the same
              wallet address you bought them with. In the event of losing
              access, or the compromise of the wallet, you agree that we are not
              responsible for your loss, nor are we able to allow you to claim
              from a different wallet since we do not undergo any KYC procedures
              when enabling purchases during the presale. The only exception to
              this is if the transaction has been completed via CARD in which
              case you will need to contact us to verify your identity.
